Part 1:

Problem 1. 

(1) Give the canonical form of the plane at infinity. 
(2) Verify that the plane at infinity is a fixed plane under a 3D affine transformation. 
(3) Given the 3D points transformation $X'=HX$, verify that a 3D plane is transformed as $\pi{}'=H^{-T}\pi{}$. (6 points)

Problem 2. 
(1) Verify that coplanar 3D points and their images are related by a 2D homography given by $H=K[r_1,r_2,t]$. 
(2) Verify that the back-projection of an image line is a 3D plane given by $\Pi{}=P^Tl$. 
(3) Verify that the images captured by a zooming camera are related by a 2D homography given by H=K'K^{-1}. (6 points)

Problem 3. 
(1) Verify that the image of the absolute conic is given by $\omega{}=(KK^T)^{-1}$. 
(2) Verify that two image points correspond to orthogonal directions satisfy $x_1^T\omega{}x_2=0$. 
(3) Verify that two constraints on the image of the absolute conic can be obtained from a homography between a 3D plane and its image $H=[h_1, h_2, h_3]$. 
(4) Show the constraints on the image of the absolute conic obtained under the square pixel assumption. (6 points)
